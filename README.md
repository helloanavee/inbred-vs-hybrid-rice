## A Quick Overview
One of the focuses of the Philippines in recent years has been food sustainability and protecting the local agricultural industry (Department of Agriculture 2022 Annual Report, 2023). Within this industry, rice is hailed as one of the top food crops in the Philippines. In recent years for this industry, there has been a contest on whether or not to produce hybrid rice instead of the farmer-preferred inbred rice. In a study by Chengappa, P.G., Gowda, M.V.S., & Janaiah A (1994), hybrid rice was proven to have a clear advantage over inbred rice. 

In essence, the primary objective of this study is to address the inquiry: **"In the context of profitability and productivity in hybrid and inbred rice, what is the optimal choice for farmers?"** The overarching research question is further dissected into specific inquiries conducive to hypothetical testing within our investigation.

## Highlights
1. The yield, labor, cost and profit and productivity in different farming situations were compared for hybrid and inbred rice variants.
2. Statistical tests, such as the One-way ANOVA, Z-test, Mann-Whitney U Test were used to test the significant difference of the two variants.
3. All tests show that there is no significant difference between the rice breeds, given the metrics that were used such as yield per hectare, total cost, and net profit.
4. Hybrid rice, promoted for superior yields, didn't significantly outperform for Isabela and Bukidnon farmers.
5. Policy makers and agricultural advisors should empower farmers through risk training, market insights, and context-specific crop advice, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.
